# Cruise API

Cruise-api is a small Java library providing an object representation of common operational oceanography concepts such as campaigns, cruises, programmes, projects and events. 
These take the form of interfaces, to be implemented by a client project. A reference implementation can be found in the project https://github.com/naturalsciences/ears3.
